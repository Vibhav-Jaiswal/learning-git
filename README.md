# Start Learning Git & Github

# Git
Git is an open-source distributed version control system. 

It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. 

It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. 

The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel.

# GitHub

# Creating a branch using the branch dropdown
 - On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

 - Select the  branch dropdown menu, in the file tree view or at the top of the integrated file editor.

 - Optionally, if you want to create the new branch from a branch other than the default branch of the repository, 
   click another branch, then select the branch dropdown menu again.

 - In the "Find or create a branch..." text field, type a unique name for your new branch, then click Create branch.


# Deleting a branch
  
 - On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

 - From the file tree view on the left, select the  branch dropdown menu, then click View all branches.
 You can also find the branch dropdown menu at the top of the integrated file editor.

 - Next to the branch that you want to delete, click  .

 - If the branch is associated with at least one open pull request, deleting the branch will close the pull requests. Read the warning, then click Delete.

# Merge Branch
In GitHub, merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another branch. 
This is commonly done when you want to incorporate changes made in a feature branch into your main branch.

Here's how to merge branches in GitHub:

- Create a Pull Request (PR): If you're working on a feature branch and want to merge it into the main branch, you'll typically start by creating a pull request. To do this:

 - Go to your repository on GitHub.
 - Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
 - Click the "New Pull Request" button.
 - Select the base branch (the branch you want to merge your changes into, often "main" or "master").
 - Select the compare branch (your feature branch).
 - Click "Create Pull Request."

Review and Discuss Changes: In the pull request, you can review the changes made in the feature branch. You can also discuss the changes with your team, make additional commits if necessary, and address any review comments.

- Merge the Pull Request: Once the changes are reviewed and approved, you can merge the pull request. To do this:

 - Click the "Merge" button.
 - Choose the merge method (e.g., merge commit, squash and merge, rebase and merge).
 - Optionally, delete the branch after merging (if you no longer need it).
 - Click "Confirm Merge."

# Create an issue
 - Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub.com.
 - Click Issues under your repository name.
 - Click New issue.
 - Choose an issue template or click Open a blank issue.
 - Fill in the details of your issue and click Submit new issue.
